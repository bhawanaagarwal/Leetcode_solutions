Problem - Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one. After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

Solution - 
method-1 - using self-join
Delete p1 from person p1
inner join person p2
where p1.id > p2.id and p1.email = p2.email

method-2 - using row_number() - better solution
Delete from person
where id in(
select id from 
(
  select id,email,
  row_number() over(partition by email order by id) as row_num
  from person
) t
where row_num > 1
)
